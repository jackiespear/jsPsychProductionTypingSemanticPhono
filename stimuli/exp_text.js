var instruction_text = "<p>Please read these instructions carefully.</p>"+"<p>This study is being conducted by Jackie Spear in the Department of Psychology. You will be asked to study a list of words, and then tested on your memory performance on these same words. At test, some of the words will be previously studied words, and some will be new. Your job will be to indicate that either yes, you did previously study a word, or no, you did not. The study is computer mediated and it takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. Also, when prompted to provide a word, respond by typing in the word 'puppy'. You will receive one credit in exchange for your participation.

var debrief_text = "<p>In an elaborative processing experiment, participants are asked to study words that include some sort of elaborative processing, and some that do not. This form of elaborative processing can take on many forms, which include, but are not limited to, speaking words aloud, typing words, or trying to generate part of a word from an incomplete fragment or associated cue. When tested on recognition for these words, participants discriminate words that were studied in a training list from words that were not presented in the training list. Further, participants routinely have higher rates of recognition for words that were subjected to the elaborative processing manipulation than the words that were not (e.g. people remember words that they typed better than words that they just read). In conjunction with this, we are going to use a computational model of memory, called MINERVA 2, to derive predictions that are consistent with human performance. The ultimate goal of this research is to be able to derive predictions about elaborative processing that account for a number of related effects.
